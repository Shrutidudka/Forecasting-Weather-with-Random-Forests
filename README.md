# **Forecasting-Weather-with-Random-Forests**

This project utilizes the Random Forest algorithm to classify weather patterns, providing an accurate and efficient method for forecasting various weather conditions. By leveraging the ensemble learning approach of Random Forests, this project aims to enhance the reliability of weather predictions, making it a valuable tool for meteorological analysis and decision-making.

## **Key features of the project include:**

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature selection, and data normalization to ensure the dataset is well-prepared for model training.
Model Training: Implementing the Random Forest algorithm to classify different weather patterns based on historical data.
Evaluation Metrics: Assessing model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to ensure robust forecasting.
Results Visualization: Presenting the forecasted weather conditions through visualizations to make the predictions more interpretable.

### This project serves as a practical application of machine learning in meteorology, demonstrating how Random Forests can be effectively used for weather forecasting.
